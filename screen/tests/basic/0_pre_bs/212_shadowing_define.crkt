shadowing an unusable object with the define operator
%%ARGS%%
%%FILE%%
# Because the variable name on the left side of the define operator is
# evaluated as an expression before the define operator is parsed, we have to
# supress any errors that result from its use (in this case, the fact that 'a'
# is unusable from a static context).

        a := 'string value';
