# This tests the fix of the interplay of badness in the parser and the
# correct accessiblity rules (where we determine accessiblity by the name
# something is referenced as, not by it's "real name").  Privacy rules should
# be applied to the variable/class name, not the function that the check gets
#  delegated to.
